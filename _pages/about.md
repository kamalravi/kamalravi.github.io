I recently **defended my Ph.D. dissertation in Computer Engineering at the University of Central Florida (Aug 2025)**, 
where I was advised by Prof. [Jiann-Shiun Yuan](https://www.ece.ucf.edu/person/jiann-s-yuan/). Supported by the [ORCGS Doctoral Fellowship](https://graduate.ucf.edu/fellowships/), my research focuses on understanding sociotechnical systems.

I bring interdisciplinary experience across natural language processing, computational social science, biomedical informatics, computer vision, system design, and applied machine learning. I am passionate about building scalable AI systems that emphasize transparency, foster user trust, and contribute positively to society.

Beyond? Outdoors, piano, books, and scenic Ole Florida!!
