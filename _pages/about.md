I  am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering, advised by Prof. [Jiann S. Yuan](https://www.ece.ucf.edu/person/jiann-s-yuan/). My research covers various areas, including natural language processing, computational social science, biomedical informatics, system design, computer vision, and applied machine learning. Supported by the [ORCGS Doctoral Fellowship](https://graduate.ucf.edu/fellowships/), my doctoral research focuses on understanding sociotechnical systems.

I am passionate about explainable AI and user experience, working on projects that emphasize transparency and build user trust in AI systems.

Outside of my research, I enjoy outdoor activities, playing the piano, and reading. I also love sailing to explore the beautiful landscapes of Florida.
