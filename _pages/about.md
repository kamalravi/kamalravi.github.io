I am a Research Fellow at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) and [Boston Children’s Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org/), where I build trustworthy, explainable, and agentic AI systems for healthcare and other high-stakes decision-making environments.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/) under the mentorship of Prof. [Jiann-Shiun Yuan](https://www.ece.ucf.edu/person/jiann-s-yuan/). My doctoral work was supported by the [ORCGS Doctoral Fellowship](https://graduate.ucf.edu/fellowships/) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. My research spans natural language processing, computational social science, biomedical informatics, computer vision, and scalable machine learning systems, with a focus on transparency, robustness, and human trust.

Beyond research, I enjoy winter hiking and skiing across New England, playing piano, cooking, reading, and capturing my travels through photography.
