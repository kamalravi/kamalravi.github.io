Ravi ([etym.](/name/)), a Computer Engineering Ph.D. candidate, is a dedicated researcher specializing in Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, System Design, and Applied Machine Learning. His innovative research works to decode the complexities of sociotechnical systems, paving the way for enhanced content moderation and a deeper understanding of online hate speech and radicalization.

Guided by [Adan Vela](https://iems.ucf.edu/faculty/adan-e-vela/) and [Rickard Ewetz](http://www.ece.ucf.edu/~ewetz/), his doctoral research aims to construct robust and explainable algorithms for continuous threat monitoring, specifically examining the transition from political discourse to violent extremism spurred by electoral motives.

Supported by the esteemed [ORCGS Doctoral Fellowship](https://graduate.ucf.edu/fellowships/), Ravi's professional trajectory includes significant roles at industry-leading organizations such as [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com/) and [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/). This experience has honed his expertise in assessing the substantial impact of social media platforms on public discourse.

Motivated by his vision of safe digital environments and a harmonious technological society, Ravi's future research ambitions lie in the realms of Cross-lingual and Multimodal NLP, aimed at augmenting content moderation strategies.

In his leisure hours, Ravi enjoys the outdoors, playing the piano, reading ([GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51003861-ravi)), and occasionally sailing to explore uncharted corners of Florida.
